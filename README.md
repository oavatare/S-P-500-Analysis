# S-P-500-Analysis

This project was meant to analyze S&P 500 returns using statistical and machine learning techniques to see if any strategies could be derived that would outperform the market in a five year period between 2012 and 2016. 

Currently, all three statistical and machine learning techniques that I applied outperformed the market between 2012 and 2016. For the model choosing S&P 500 components that had outperformed the market and going long those stocks the next year, my model was up 111% relative to the market return of 87% between 2012 and 2016. For the KNN machine learning model, my model was up 145% relative to the market return of 87% between 2012 and 2016. For the logistic regression machine learning model, my model was up 83% relative to the market return of 56% between 2012 and 2015.
